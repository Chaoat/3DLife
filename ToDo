Roots
1. We're using python probably.
2. We need to find a 3D python library. So far I've seen this http://vpython.org/
3. For interface I'm thinking of using TKInter. I know Andrew disagrees, so I'd like to see his suggestion.

Features
1. Ability to have different rules. Creating own rules would be cool too.
2. I think there are some rules that have non binary states, as in they can be alive, unhealthy, then dead, or any number of states inbetween.
3. Variable number of dimensions. This is the key thing that seperates us from already existing life implementations.
4. Multiple time dimensions?
5. Simple interface. I think there already exists tools that do at least some of the new things we want to try out, but they're all extremely impenetrable.
